validictory |release|
=====================

Overview
--------

validictory is a general purpose Python data validator that allows validation of arbitrary Python data structures.

Schema format is based on the `JSON Schema proposal <http://json-schema.org>`_, so combined with :mod:`json` the
library is also useful as a validator for JSON data.

Contains code derived from `jsonschema <http://json-schema.org/implementations.html>`_ by Ian Lewis and Ysuke Muraoka.
